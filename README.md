# Symbolic-Calculator
This project is inspired by my love for the Casio  fx-115 ES calculator. Ideally I would like to be able to replicate all of the functionality of that calculator in this project and maybe extend it. My other goal is to learn to use the Qt5 GUI creator to make a nice looking interactive calculator GUI.
